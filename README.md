# lip_reading_project
This project is on lip reading classification through data from event based cameras. 
The objective is to analyse and classify data generated by an event camera, by any mean. The event lip reading dataset that we will use has been collected at i3s lab during the summer 2022 with a GEN3.1 VGA camera, and has been cleaned and pre-processed (center / crop / rescale on the mouth area) during winter 2023.
There are 10 different words that can be given as outputs.
